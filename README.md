I have created a digital clock using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The clock displays the current time along with the temperature and latitude/longitude of the current location. The temperature data is obtained through the OpenWeatherMap API, and the latitude/longitude data is obtained through the latlong.net website. You can access the live clock by following this link: https://aman-arabzadeh.github.io/time.github.io/

For those who are interested in creating similar projects, I used the resources available on the Mozilla Developer Network to learn how to work with APIs. I also utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information. Please note that you will need to register for an API key to use this service. Additionally, I Was inspired by the  latlong.net website.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I hope you find the clock useful and informative
